# WFAnywhere - Remote Working

## About this Site

This site will provide users with a directory of local listings in which users can visit and work from remotely.

The site is primarily designed for those users who either as Freelancers, need a working environment they can meet with colleagues and clients, or for those working from home full-time since lockdown during the pandemic, need a suitable place to work for the day with spaces to make calls.


## User Experience (UX)
As the primary purpose of this site is to quickly provide users with information that they are likely to use in conjunction with wider research. Since this site will likely be one of many similar sites they visit, the user needs to quickly learn what content the site provides and convince them that reading further is worth their attention.

In order to achieve this, the site is built with simplicity in mind - a simple landing page that clearly sets out the purpose, followed by a single directory listing page, that also allows the user to chose how they view (via list or map) and quickly search for and filter listings that are most relevant to them (through keyword search and area and tag filters) 

### User Stories
 
- #### First time visitors
    - As a first time visitor, I want to quickly decide whether spending more time on this site will be worthwhile in answering my needs.
    - I am only interested in listings that are within suitable distance to me.
    - I will likely use the content from this site and others to form a decision on the best location to visit, so my time on this site will be limited.
- #### Returning visitors
    - As a returning visitor, I have already seen the content from the site on the initial visit - I am only looking for new listings.
    - Part of the reason I am returning may be to give feedback on a listing after visiting their location.
- #### Freelancers who work irregular or part time hours
    - As a Freelancer, my day will likely be split between multiple projects and clients. I don't always need a location to work from for a full day, so I want to see listings that do not require a full day booking.
    - I am looking for locations that will allow me to meet clients and collaborate for a few hours at a time.

- #### A full time employee who cannot work from home comfortably
    - As a full time employee working from home due to the pandemic, I am solely interested in listings that I know I can work from for the full day. 
    - I want to see only the listings that will have quiet places I can make calls with a good internet connection
- #### Location owners
    - As someone who owns a location users can work remotely from, I want to add my listing to the site with ease in order to promote my business.
    - I want to see what other listings are offering in order to learn more about the site users and tailor my listing content accordingly. 
- #### Site owner
    - As the site owner, I want to ensure that information is accurate and user feedback is received, to improve value to the user.
    - I want users to share the site content with others to drive traffic to site.
